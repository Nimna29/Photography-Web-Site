  <p>Pixcellence Art Studio is owned My Mr. Vihanga Savinda, a young and skilled 
      photographer. He began photographing in high school and has since progressed to 
      become a professional photography. In the past 3 years, there are he had lots of 
      experience in this field. Always try to give better quality photographs for our 
      customers. <br>The photography industry is one of the few that can unquestionably survive in any 
      area of the world if it is well-positioned. The photography industry may brag about 
      directly or indirectly employing many people all around the world. One of the best 
      things about the photography profession is that it offers a wide range of 
      specializations, from wedding or portrait photography to special events 
      photography, wildlife photography, and travel photography, to name a few. Above 
      all, we chose to start a photography business because, after conducting our due 
      diligence and study, we discovered that it is a highly profitable business if carefully 
      planned and managed.</p>

  <p>Photography is an Art, and any creation is only as good as its creator allows it to be.  
      The photographer’s creativity is paramount in taking good photos. After all the photograph is not what exists, 
      but what the photographer envisions in the picture. These interpretations can come in many forms , 
      from subtle changes in the tone to changing how the viewer sees the photograph entirely. 
      As the saying goes “Composition is everything is Photography”. These compositions are the result of the photographer’s creativity in action.</p>

  <p>Composition is Key but the knack for capturing the little details is just as Important. These can take a photo of an ordinary thing,  
      “Go the extra Mile”.  The Lighting, Composition, Subject, the Cohesiveness of all these aspects is needed to create the perfect photograph. </p>

  <p>Perfect photographs aren’t created in a hurry. There are many variables that can affect the quality of the photograph at any time. 
    Even when the conditions are perfect a hurried shot can throw off the quality of the photo. It takes patience and dedication to make sure 
    all those things are in Order and to achieve the best outcome. Even when none of the conditions are favorable a good photographer makes the 
    best with what they have.</p>

  <p>Unless you are planning on strictly being a lone nature photographer, the art of communication is essential for the Field. Clients, 
  Other Photographers, Oblivious bystanders, unruly babies are some of the problems that face the everyday photographer. 
  And know-how to connect and communicate with them cannot be understated. A relaxed and focused subject can be the difference between 
  a good photo and one that would be deleted on the spot. </p>

  <div style="color:#ddd;background-color:#282E34;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify; font-family: Poppins;">
  <p>It is the difference between taking a photograph because you have to and taking one because you want to. 
    Passion can make the outcome look better because the photographer constantly finds new ways to improve his skills and photography. 
    The need to perfect one’s craft can and will lead to the greatest results. Passion for an art allows to us push further and harder and perfect ourselves.</p>
